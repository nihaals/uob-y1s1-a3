go up
dead end, go back down
down again
I want to go east
now I would like to go back west
I want to go north this time
go back south
how about northwest
I'm not lucky, go back southeast
northeast is my next choice
let's try south
west now
southwest is the way to go
explore northeast
ooops, back where I've started, go southeast
climb up
maybe north is the correct way
I'm getting tired, west
last try, climb up to top floor
dead end, I give up, quit
